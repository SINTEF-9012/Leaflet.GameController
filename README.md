Leaflet.GameController
======================

This is an interaction handler for [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), prodiving support for gamepads.

### Usage

```javascript
map.GamepadController.enable();
```

### Development version

*This is a development version*. It requires Leaflet-0.8dev and a recent web browser with a working HTML5 Gamepad API (draft).

This version is tested only on Chrome canary with a 3D mouse (SpaceNavigator). While it should be working with other browsers and game controllers, some calibration and axis selection is required.
