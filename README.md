Leaflet.GameController
======================

This is an interaction handler for [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), prodiving support for gamepads.

[Example](http://sintef-9012.github.io/Leaflet.GameController/example.html)

### Usage

```javascript
map.GamepadController.enable();
```

### Unstable version

*This is unstable*. It requires a recent web browser with a working [HTML5 Gamepad API](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/) (draft).

This version is only tested on Chrome canary with a 3D mouse (SpaceNavigator). It should be working with other browsers or game controllers after some calibration and axis selection.
